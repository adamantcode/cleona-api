You are the expert here.I also understand that every woman comes to her birth with a unique life story and unique needs and therefore no one else can or should tell you what is best for you. Some women are more comfortable in a hospital setting for their birth and I fully support that choice. My own birthing experience includes hospital and home labors, each exactly where it should have been. For numerous reasons, some personal and some medical, a birthing woman may require one or many interventions. Whether in a hospital, birth center or at home, it is your body, your baby, your birth. I will listen to your story and be a resource for evidence-based information as you decide when, where and how to have your baby. Research shows clearly that for mothers and babies in low risk pregnancies, little or no intervention during birth yields the best outcomes in terms of material and infant health, successful breastfeeding and other indicators of well being. But for all its simple, incredible and precision mechanics, birth can sometimes be unpredictable and complicated. The best choices come from having information and strong support. Toward that end, I will seek to provide you with the most accurate, unbiased information possible as your transition into parenthood and I will strive to be strength for your journey. If you are expecting a loss, disability, adoption or other circumstance that requires special time and attention or expertise, please give me a call. These are areas in which I have ample experience and a particular desire to assist mothers and families.","If you have chosen a birth center for your family you have made a strong commitment to an unmedicated birth and I applaud you for that your choice. You have chosen a setting that will help you meet your goals. But whether you birth at a center, at home or in the hospital, you can expect the same focused, compassionate, information-based care from me. Every labor has its highs and lows and it is my goal to provide steady, centered support for you through it all. As a midwifey consumer myself, I am thrilled you have chosen to entrust your care and your baby into the hands of providers who fully trust birth, believe in your personal power and in your body and are pledged to protect this sacred moment for your baby.","If you are having your baby at home you have made a commitment to an unmedicated, truly family-centered birth and I am very excited for you and your family! But again, whether you birth at a center, at home or in the hospital, you can expect the same focused, compassionate, information-based care from me. Even in the more comforting and quiet setting of home, your experience of birth will be heightened by steady, centered support and it is my goal to be just that for you and your family through it all. Research shows that home birth is as safe or safer than hospital delivery for healthy low risk mothers and babies.

I am a doula, certified lactation counselor, licensed clinical social worker and mother. I approach pregnancy, labor, birth and parenting from a realistic and compassionate perspective. As a doula, I offer empathetic guidance and unconditional support to pregnant people and their families as they grow. I love supporting people through exciting, difficult and emotional experiences and I am forever grateful to the folks who welcome me into their lives. I have experience working with a diverse range of people and offer an individualized, tailored approach to every family I meet. My background and training as a mental health professional informs my views regarding pregnancy and birth — I see these processes as opportunities to nurture relationships both with others and with one's self. Birth and parenthood are chances and spaces in which to grow, explore and gain a sense of self. I strive for all births to be positive and met with excitement, joy, some healthy trepidation and lots of love. I am originally from Suffolk county, Long Island, lived in Queens for many years and now live in Nassau County. I am an active member of the NYC/Metropolitan area birth-worker community.

Nurses are not able to provide you continuous support, encouragement and nurturing that a doula can provide you with because they have other patients that they attend. The benefits of bringing a doula with you to the hospital are unsurmountable. The doula grows to know you throughout the course of your pregnancy and can provide comfort to you and connect with you in ways that the professional staff may not be able to. Most nurses that I have worked with are absolutely thrilled when they see that my mama has me with them. They can breathe a little easier knowing that I'm there watching over their patients. In the face of ever-changing policies surrounded by our current climate as we continue to navigate the global pandemic, I do not judge families on their decision to be vaccinated, or unvaccinated. I have chosen that vaccinations are important to me and my family.

I also became a certified health coach with focus in prenatal and postpartum health and fitness in 2022 as well and actively am taking clients seeking for a helping hand in overcoming obstacles or pursuing a health goal in all aspects of their lives. I was honored to serve as an MSW intern from 08/2021 through 05/2022 with the Milwaukee Department of Health's Birth Outcomes Made Better (BOMB) Doula Program assisting them with program initiative and analysis. I have additional service as a volunteer doula with the Pasadena Department of Public Health, Department of Maternal Affairs, and Black Infant's Health Program. I was also a volunteer doula and childbirth educator for The Harvest Home in Santa Monica, CA. My passion lies with not only improving birth outcomes in maternal infant health, but shedding a light on the importance of maternal mental health. Now that I have finished my graduate degree, I will be focusing on ways to continue to educate and support families about mom's mental health, and am currently training to be a state ambassador for Postpartum Support International where I have completed my training in advanced psychotherapy with Postpartum Support International (PSI) and Moms 2020.

As a military spouse, Aubrey has attended births all over the country and has supported a wide variety of birthing situations and locations. Her 12 years of invaluable experience includes supporting active duty Military families in Missouri, North Carolina, Texas & Indiana and serving low/no income families through nonprofit Doula organizations in Missouri (The Doula Foundation) and Texas (San Antonio Birth Doulas). Aubrey’s journey to become a doula began when she was pregnant in 2010. She began to really educate herself on all things relating to birth in order to prepare for the water-birth of her now 13 year old daughter. In doing so, a spark was ignited within her and she knew she had found her passion as a doula. In 2011, she suffered a pulmonary embolism caused by the use of hormonal birth control. While recovering, she kick started her doula career to help women become well informed of their decisions before, during, and after pregnancy. As a doula, her main goal is to help empower families to make informed decisions. No matter what a family envisions for the birth of their baby, Aubrey wants them to enter into parenthood feeling knowledgeable, supported, and at peace with how the birth unfolded.","Wabash, IN  | Service range 50 miles  | Please contact me if you are outside a 50 mile radius.",All Hospitals

My career as a medical assistant gave me an opportunity to learn about prenatal care in detail. I also worked as a Family Planning counselor for 3 years between 2010-2013. Since 2005 I have been working as an on-call doula for low income Latino families in Boston, a grant program that pays the doula a small fee so that women who are non-english speaking and often low-income and education, have support at no cost to them. We provide Doula services continuously through labor and birth, interpret, and help navigate them and their families through the hospital system. I was certified as a birth Doula through DONA international in 2012 and have enjoyed expanding into my own doula practice since then. I taught HypnoBirthing-The Mongan Method of childbirth education for over 3 years and enjoyed seeing how excited pregnant people become in anticipation of a joyful birth through the series, but I recently became uncomfortable with some flaws I perceive in that program, and so have written my own curriculum after completing an extensive childbirth educator program with BACE-NMC. I focus on mindfulness with evidence-based practices and how to take charge of your experience. I will be certified by spring 2018 so please contact me to set up private classes, or visit my website to look for soon-to-come class offerings. I have personal experience with cloth diapering, baby-led latching, baby-led weaning, and baby wearing. I am also trained to give breast feeding support, I am working towards certification as a Certified lactation Educator, and have breast fed two babies of my own.","Billerica, MA  | Service range 50 miles  | I'm more concerned with the time it takes to get to you then the miles.

Through countless hours supporting families, I have learned that parents are experts on their children. For sure, I am a specialist on all things bumps and babies, but they are the true masters on their newborns. It is my job and goal to set them up for success, build their confidence, educate, foster and nourish their bond, give solid parenting tools, and lead them to the point they no longer need me because they have accomplished a mutual goal: thrive in this new journey! When I join a family during labor, I appreciate and honor that I am witnessing one of the most precious and vulnerable moments in their lives. I observe and adjust my support strategies to meet the family’s needs, reassure them that they are making the right decisions based on their values and wishes, and accompany them on that beautiful path until the baby is in their arms. I bring into the birth space various suggestions in my toolbox and will work with the birthing parent to meet the best coping plan, be it words of affirmation, hip squeezes, TENS unit use, movement, humor, and so much more. As a Latina immigrant, I have experienced the challenges of adjusting to life in a new country without family nearby. I know first-hand how challenging and scary it can be to reach out for help in sensitive times.

No stranger to the learning curve of parenthood, I am committed to helping new families find their true north on this life-changing journey. I strive to validate & fulfill a family’s birth preferences through evidence based education, access to quality perinatal care, & personal empowerment. I let my intuition, expansive knowledge, & instinct guide my hands-on support style, & help create a nurturing environment that fosters confidence, self-advocacy, & love. I aspire to give birthing individuals & families the space to be themselves to create deep connections during this beautiful, miraculous & vulnerable time. 2 full length childbirth classes are included in my birth doula support package! WHY DID I GET INTO BIRTH WORK: My interest in pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum began with my own journey into parenthood in 2013. I decided to become a doula after the birth of my second daughter in 2016. Those experiences are what ignited my passion for supporting families from conception through the first year. For thousands of years, across all cultures and colors, birthing people have been surrounded by others throughout perinatal period. Our society today does not promote this communal support network that taught our ancestors how to stay comfortable in pregnancy, how to birth or breastfeed, and most importantly, heal afterwards. I seek to empower families through the steep learning curve of becoming a larger family so that they can reconnect with their instincts, & know they are not alone on this unpredictable journey. SOME ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: My training as a dancer, actor, singer, and certified yoga teacher provides me with a deep understanding of the capabilities of the human body. I encourage my birthing persons to be active participants in their pregnancy and birth by being their cheerleader, and incorporating movement, yoga and Spinning Babies® into their daily prenatal and laboring routines.","Beverly, MA  | Service range 30 miles  | My client base is focused on North Shore Residents.",All Hospitals

I also know that, sometimes, accessing and trusting your knowing can be tricky.

I specialize in working with families who are seeking high-touch, relational support due to past or present fertility challenges, trauma, or generally heightened anxiety. I also situate the work I do in a political context, so if you value modern medicine and medical providers -- but are keenly aware that our medical system was not built by or for you -- I would love to hear from you.

Educated through both Wise Woman Way of Birth Doula Training and Douglas College and Certified through DONA, Doulas of North America, we draw on our knowledge and experience to provide emotional support and physical comfort during your pregnancy, labour and delivery. We can provide reassurance and perspective to you and your partner, make suggestions for labor progress, help with relaxation, massage, positioning and other techniques for comfort. As your Doulas, we are working for you, not your caregiver or hospital. Our Doula Collective contains three birth doulas, as well as two postpartum doulas. We operate using an on-call schedule, similar to that of midwives and obstetricians. This system allows for a well rested doula 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for your birth. We each have a vast array of experience and specialty training which we share among the collective to broaden our overall scope of tricks and tools. When I’m not working as a Doula I am a Children and Youth Counsellor, Parenting Group Facilitator and Parent-Child Mother Goose Facilitator at a non-profit agency. I am also a Buddy up for Breastfeeding Volunteer with Fraser Health. I offer breastfeeding phone support for new mothers who may be experiencing breastfeeding challenges All of our doulas have experience with twins, VBACs, HBACs first time mothers, anxiety and more.","Maple Ridge, BC  | Service range 50 miles",Some Hospitals
